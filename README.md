This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the web client 

In the project directory, run:
### `yarn install`
### `npm start`

The first command will download all third party libraries.
The second one runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Nice to have in next commits

- Unit tests for existent code: react components, redux actions, reducers, etc.
